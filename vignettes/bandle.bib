	Abstract = {The Bioconductor project is an initiative for the
		  collaborative creation of extensible software for
		  computational biology and bioinformatics. The goals
		  of the project include: fostering collaborative
		  development and widespread use of innovative
		  software, reducing barriers to entry into
		  interdisciplinary scientific research, and promoting
		  the achievement of remote reproducibility of
		  research results. We describe details of our aims
		  and methods, identify current challenges, compare
		  Bioconductor to other open bioinformatics projects,
		  and provide working examples.},
