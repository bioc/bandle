# The `bandle` package


The [**bandle**](https://ococrook.github.io/bandle/) (Bayesian Analysis of Differential Localisation Experiments) package is R/Bioconductor package for analysis differential localisation experiments, include storage, computation, statistics and visulisations. 


# Installation requirements

Users will require a working version of R, currently at least version >4. It is recommended to use [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com). The package can then be installed using the Bioconductor or `devtools` package. The package should take a few minutes to install on a regular desktop or laptop. The package will need to be loaded using `library(bandle)`

To install the stable Bioconductor release (recommended):

```{r,}
## unless BiocManager is already installed
install.packages("BiocManager")
## then
BiocManager::install("bandle")
```


Unstable/development package version install:

```{r,}
devtools::install_github("ococrook/bandle")
```

We do not advise you install the unstable version unless you know what you are doing as not all pre-release features may be tested or documented.


# Basic ideas and concepts

The `bandle` package is designed  start with replicated MS spatial proteomics data in `MSnSets` and perform a workflow (see Vignettes section).

We recommend reading our other workflow manuscripts:

The BANDLE manusript is currently on biorxiv:

# Vignettes

There are currently two vignettes that accompany the package. The first vignette [v01-getting-started](https://ococrook.github.io/bandle/articles/v01-getting-started.html) provides an introduction to the `bandle` package and follows a short theortical example of how to perform differential localisation analysis of quantitative proteomics data using the BANDLE model (Crook et al. 2022 doi: https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.01.04.425239). Explanation and general recommendations of the input parameters are provided here.

The second vignette [v02-workflow](https://ococrook.github.io/bandle/articles/v02-workflow.html) is a more comprehensive workflow which follows a real-life use case applying the methods and workflow to the analysis of the human THP-1 monocyte system.

These vignettes can be found through the Bioconductor landing page for `bandle`, here in the repo and also the *Articles* tab of the accompanying web page.

Notes on run time: A small dataset can take around an hour to run; for large dataset we recommend a a compute server. The longest the analysis has taken has been a couple of hours on a single compute node. The demo take a few minutes to run.

# Documentation

Documentation to run the main functions can be found in the vignette or by typing `?bandle` in the console after loading the package.
