# Basic ideas and concepts

- start with replicated MS spatial proteomics data in `MSnSets` and perform a workflow

We recommend reading our other workflow manuscripts:

# Installation requirements

Users will require a working version of R, currently at least version >4. It is recommend to use RStudio. The package can then be installed using the `devtools` package. The package should take a few minutes to install on a regular desktop or laptop. The package will need to be loaded using `library(bandle)`

```{r,}
devtools::install_github("ococrook/bandle")
```

# Examples

A simple demo is given in the vigenettes folder with clear demonstrations of the input and output. A small dataset can take around an hour to run; for large dataset we recommend a a compute server. The longest the analysis has taken has been a couple of hours on a single compute node. The demo take a few minutes to run.

The vignettes include an example of the analysis of the THP-1 monocyte system, as well as simulated examples.


# Documentation

Documentation to run the main functions can be found in the vignette or by typing ?bandle in the consol after loading the package.
